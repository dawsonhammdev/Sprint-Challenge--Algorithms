#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) This would be linear because the time it takes for this to run willvary dependening on the value of a.  If a is large then it will take longer.


b) The run time for this would be quadratic due to the nested loops.


c) The run time for this would be constant because the operation time would always be the same even depending on the value of bunnies.

## Exercise II
