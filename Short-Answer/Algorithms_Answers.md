#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) If we divide n^3 by n^2 = n.  So the Big O would be constant, O(1), because the number of operations is constant.


b) This will be Logarithmic O(log n), because as the sixe of the input increases the runtime and space used will grow at a slghtly slower rat.


c) This will be Exponential, O(c^n), because as the size of the input increases the runtime or space used will grow at a much faster rate.
